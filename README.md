## Project: Image Classification by Egor Ermilov

### Description

In this project, I classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset has been preprocessed, then a convolutional neural network has been trained on all the samples. I normalized the images, one-hot encoded the labels, built convolutional layers, max pool layers, and fully connected layers. At the end, you'll see their predictions on the sample images.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** with the [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) library installed
